A side project I am working on to help support my sisters small business.
The goal is to offer her clients a visual option to scheduling appointments at her salon, allow clients to look through photos of her work, as well as giving them all the information they may need on a particular service.
This app will not only show off her skills, and assist her in the daily scheduling, but also showcase skills I am learning whilst in school.
